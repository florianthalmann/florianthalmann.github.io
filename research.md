As a researcher I am mainly concerned with computer music, mathematical music theory, knowledge representation, machine learning, and interdisciplinary arts. My current interests include:

* alternative music composition and improvisation systems
* ontological and mathematical representations of music
* musical human-computer interaction and gestural control
* intuitive control of sound synthesis, sound design, and algorithmic composition
* musical applications of machine learning
* models of creative processes
* interactive visual representation of complex musical objects
