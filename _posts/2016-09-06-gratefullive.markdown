A platform for the representation and discovery of live music recordings and associated artefacts of the band The Grateful Dead. It links material from the Grateful Dead collection of the Internet Archive with data aggregated from several additional Web resources discussing and describing these events. These data include descriptions and images of physical artefacts such as tickets, posters and fan photos, as well as other information, e.g. about location and weather. The system uses signal processing techniques for the analysis and alignment of the digital recordings. During the discovery, users can juxtapose and compare different recordings of a given concert, or different performances of a given song by interactively blending between them.
