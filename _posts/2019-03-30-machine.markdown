The Semantic Machine is an contextual composition created in collaboration with
Tracy Redhead. Via mobile sensors and data taken from public APIs, the work adjusts to the listenerâ€™s context and varies its musical characteristics depending on location, time of the day and weather. We used traditional music production tools as well as the Semantic Player, a dynamic music web framework which allows data manipulation techniques familiar from computer music and the video game industry.
