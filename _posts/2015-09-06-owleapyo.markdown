Owleapyo is a Python live performance system based on semantic technologies
and deep learning which listens to and interacts with a live performer using
a number of controllers, including a modified version of the Ableton Push
and the Leap Motion. It is based on a multidimensional model of musical
expression capable of capturing and sending MIDI and sensor data.

Performance excerpts with my python-based **owleapyo** system which learns and imitates expressive parameters of the performer via a gestural or midi controller.
