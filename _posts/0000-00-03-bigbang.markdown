The BigBang rubette brings gestural composition to Rubato Composer. It allows users to create and interact with its mathematical structures in an intuitive way and tracks their creative process. BigBang is still being expanded and I am currently adapting it as a standalone software on Android. In the meantime, a current version of Rubato Composer including BigBang can be obtained via email to <a href="mailto:thalm007@umn.edu">thalm007@umn.edu</a>.

A new version of BigBang records the creative process of its users and allows them to interact with the past.

A new version of BigBang allows for real-time sound synthesis. Its interactive way of tracking the creative process is well suited for sound design.

Rubato Composer's versatility and generality becomes tangible with new examples of musical datatypes.
