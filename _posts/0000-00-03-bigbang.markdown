The BigBang rubette brings gestural composition to Rubato Composer. It allows users to create and interact with its mathematical structures in an intuitive way and tracks their creative process. BigBang is still being expanded and I am currently adapting it as a standalone software on Android. In the meantime, a current version of Rubato Composer including BigBang can be obtained via email to <a href="mailto:thalm007@umn.edu">thalm007@umn.edu</a>.
