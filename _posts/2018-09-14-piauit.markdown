Web application and composition for the exhibition Play it Again! Use it Together with the Open Music Archive at Victoria Gallery in Liverpool, where Shellac records were being digitized, analyzed automatically, and fed into an archiving system based on Semantic Web technologies. A Node server generates an infinite growing composition assembled from fragments of recently digitized material, which was played in the exhibition space and could be streamed live on the website using web audio.
