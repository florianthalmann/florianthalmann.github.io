Plunderphonics is a web application that automatically creates intelligent
collages from music available in the Live Music Archive of the Internet Archive.
For example, it arranges all the different versions of a particular song from
chronologically and generates a diachronic transsection which is smoothly mixed
together based on automatic music analysis while displaying
artefacts from the corresponding live concerts gathered from various web platforms
and linked together using Semantic Web technologies.
